# **GrofDB** ðŸŒŸ  
Data systems are major considerations during system designs of any kind. Proper handling of files and data either through Relational database management systems, NoSQL Databases or even Key-Value stores cannot be overemphasized. GrofDB is a network available key value store database that is built based on the design principles of _Log Structured Merge Trees_ in this project my approach conveys a wholistic and Lean structure. GrofDB is designed to solve some of the issues traditional operating systems face in File systems modules which are high latency and high memory usages and sometimes Runtime complexities.

## **Description**  
**GrofDB** is a network available key value store database that is built based on the design principles of _Log Structured Merge Trees_ which can be incorporated in any system to serve as a datastore. GrofDB provides low latency during writes and reads operations on any system it is incorporated on. it also provides a fault tolerant system which helps to preserve data incase of unforseen circumstances or a system crash. GrofDB pays attention to the ACID properties of database engineering to enhance data safety and durability, It also uses algorithms like Quicksort (efficient for sorting large datasets), Binary search and Log Merge trees for internal file operations.

### **Key Highlights:**  
- **Problem it solves**: High Latency and High Memory utilisation issues in mordern Database systems  
- **Where can it be used**: Embedded systems Datastores, Web systems that require any form of Datastore etc.
